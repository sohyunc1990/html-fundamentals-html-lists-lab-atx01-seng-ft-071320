## Learning Goals

1. Recognize unordered and ordered HTML Lists
2. Create unordered lists
3. Identify the ordered list tag
4. Create ordered lists

## Introduction

Many HTML tags behave in unique ways. Some apply automatic styling, like `p`
tags that create margins around text.  Some, like the header tags, increase the
font size. Using these tags delineates our content. When reading HTML, using the
correct tags informs us of what the content's purpose is. If we see an `h1` tag,
we know that we're looking at a _big_ page header. In this lesson, we're going to
be looking at a few new tags that help us organize _lists_ of related content.

## Recognize Unordered And Ordered HTML Lists

Lets say, for instance, we were building a personal website and wanted to list
out our favorite foods. We _could_ write this like so:

```html
<body>
  <p>Ham and Cheese</p>
  <p>Grilled Cheese</p>
  <p>Nacho Cheese French Fries</p>
  <p>Cheese soup</p>
  <p>Cheese and crackers</p>
  <p>Sushi</p>
</body>
```

The above would create a new line on the page for each food, but doesn't really
indicate that these things are related.  Using the built in `ul`, `ol` and `li`
HTML tags however, we can group related list content together. We call such a
grouping a "list."

In HTML, we create lists using the `<ul>` tag, which stands for _unordered
list_, along with the `<li>` tag for each _list item_.

To make a list, we write out the opening and closing `<ul>` tags, and inside
them, we'll add `<li>` tags, each listing a single month. Going back to our
favorite foods example, if we wanted convert it to a list, it would look like
this:

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Ham and Cheese</li>
  <li>Grilled Cheese</li>
  <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries</li>
  <li>Cheese soup</li>
  <li>Cheese and crackers</li>
  <li>Sushi</li>
</ul>
```

Now, instead of just having each item show up on a new line, the content will
also be slightly indented and a bullet will appear next to each of them.

Lists are very flexible and we can even nest lists _inside_ of lists. Say we
wanted to breakdown our favorite foods by category. We may have multiple
categories and one or more items in _each_:

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Sandwiches
    <ul>
      <li>Ham and Cheese</li>
      <li>Grilled Cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Snacks
    <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries</li>
    <li>Cheese and crackers</li>
  </li>
  <li>Soups
    <ul>
      <li>Cheese soup</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sushi
    <ul>
      <li>Spicy Salmon Rolls</li>
      <li>California Rolls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the nested lists will now be _further_ indented and instead of
a solid bullet, they will appear with hollow bullets, indicating a sub-list.
Adding nested list one level deeper will make _square_ bullets appear, allowing
us to easily display related and nested content in a readable format.

## Create Unordered Lists

The first part of this challenge is to make the first 2 tests pass by:

1. Creating an unordered list 
2. Nesting each grilled cheese ingredient as a list item wrapped in `<li>` tags

Start up `httpserver` or open `index.html` in your browser. Let's say we wanted
to list out the ingredients required for making a grilled cheese sandwich.  The
ingredients are: `2 slices of bread`, `4 slices of cheese`, `1 tbsp of butter`.

For the first part of this challenge, in `index.html`, create an unordered list
that displays these ingredients. Run `learn` to see if you can pass the first
test. If you've done things correctly, you'll now be passing the first test,
but there are more tests to pass! We now need to turn our attention to the next
test.

Okay, now, lets say we wanted to make our grilled cheese a little more exciting
and add a couple of cheeses, `cheddar`, `mozzarella`, and `pepper jack`.

To pass the second test, inside the `li` of `4 slices of cheese`, add a nested
unordered list that lists out the three types of cheese.

If your first two tests are passing, great! It's time to talk about another type
of list!

## Identify the Ordered List Tag

Unordered lists are great for organizing related content where it doesn't matter
what goes first, like in our grilled cheese ingredients.  In situations where we
_want_ items to be displayed in a specific, numbered order, we will want to use
the _ordered list_ tag, which is written as `<ol>` instead of `<ul>`. Both use
`<li>` tags inside, but this time, `<ol>` will display a numbered list instead
of bullets. If say, we wanted to write a _ranked_ list of favorite foods, it
might look like:

```HTML
<h3>Top 5 Favorite Foods</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Grilled Cheese</li>
  <li>Sushi</li>
  <li>Cheese and crackers</li>
  <li>Cheese soup</li>
  <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries</li>
</ol>
```

> Feel free to test this out by adding it to `index.html`, saving and refreshing
> the tab where the file is open. Now, `Grilled Cheese` will be displayed as `1.
> Grilled Cheese` as the #1 food (where it belongs).

Nested ordered lists works the same as unordered, but instead of hollow and
square bullets, each nested list will still display numbers.

**Note:** In a nested list, you _must_ provide the `ol` or `ul` wrapper.  Otherwise, an
`li` inside another `li` will just be displayed as two items at the same level.
This is because technically, you do not need to write a closing `li` tag.  The
following example will be displayed the same as the previous:

```HTML
<h3>Top 5 Favorite Foods</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Grilled Cheese
  <li>Sushi
  <li>Cheese and crackers
  <li>Cheese soup
  <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries
</ol>
```

## Create Ordered Lists

To complete the challenge write the necessary HTML to pass the tests:

3. Create an ordered list 
4. Nest each step for creating grilled cheese as a list item wrapped in `<li>` tags

Okay, so we've got our grilled cheese ingredients, but what about the steps
requires to make a grilled cheese? Steps to a recipe need to be
in order, otherwise we may end up with burnt cheese covered in bread and topped
with a square of butter. The steps to making a basic grilled cheese would be:
`Spread butter on bread and frying pan`, `Place bread in frying pan and fry`,
`Add cheese on top of bread`, `Cover with second slice of bread`, `Turn over and
fry for 2 minutes`

***
Once you've written an ordered list that displays these 5 steps correctly, run `learn` 
to see the tests pass.

## Conclusion

Lists in HTML are very useful for organizing related content, and are really the
only way indicate that content is related with basic HTML.  Using unordered
lists ends up being very useful for more than just listing favorite foods and
ingredients.  Its possible, for instance, to use list elements to organize
navigation links - with styling, we make the content look however we want:
remove the bullets, make them line up horizontally, but in our HTML they will
still be organized and easy to read.
